Bioinformatics Research Scientist-Gene Regulation,65,118,91.5,$65K-$118K (Glassdoor est.),"St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital is seeking multiple Bioinformatics Research Scientists to study the role of genome and other nuclear organization in pediatric cancers. Recognized for state-of-the-art computational infrastructure, well-established analytical pipelines, and deep genomic analysis expertise, St. Jude offers a work environment where you will directly impact the care of pediatric cancer patients. As a Bioinformatics Research Scientist, your responsibilities include analyzing data generated from a variety of second- and third-generation sequencing applications that interrogate a broad range of human gene regulatory biology.

The Abraham lab studies gene expression-regulation mechanisms in healthy and diseased mammalian cells. We are recruiting computational biologists to collaboratively develop computational tools and frameworks to analyze high-throughput sequencing (-omics) data. We build analytical software pipelines to find answers to biological questions about gene regulation in big datasets, usually from applied sequencing experiments like ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and Hi-ChIP. Our interests center on enhancers and super-enhancers. Specifically, we seek to understand how these regulatory elements establish gene expression programs in healthy cells, and how enhancers are altered by mutation, abused by mistargeting, and targetable with drugs in diseased cells. We focus on characterizing the core regulatory circuitries driving disease-relevant cells, and on understanding how mutations in the non-coding DNA of such cells can drive disease, including cancers, through gene misregulation.

The successful candidate will become a fundamental component of a multidisciplinary, inter-institutional team assembled to study how genome structures meaningfully differ between normal and pediatric cancer cells.

Ideal candidates will have experience building, tailoring, and deploying analysis pipelines using widely available genomic analysis toolkits (e.g. bedtools, samtools), as well as experience managing large numbers of datasets. The successful candidate will be tasked with collaborative research within and beyond the lab, so strong communication and interpersonal skills are essential. Additional experience in fundamental understanding of gene expression mechanisms (e.g. transcription factors, enhancers, genome structure, and transcriptional condensates), and experience building succinct, clear figures using R are preferred.

The department of Computational Biology provides access to high performance computing clusters, cloud computing environment, innovative visualization tools, highly automated analytical pipelines and mentorship from faculty scientists with experience in data analysis, data management and delivery of high-quality results for competitive projects. We encourage first author, high profile publications to share this element of discovery. Take the first step to join our team by applying now!

Targeted therapies work by attacking cells that express particular proteins on their surface. Unfortunately, both diseased and healthy cells often express the same proteins, resulting in collateral damage to healthy cells.

At Vor, we engineer hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to lack a biologically redundant target protein, then transplant these cells into the patient.

These eHSCs give rise to generations of new healthy blood cells that are effectively invisible to targeted therapies. Diseased cells displaying the target protein and are then vulnerable to attack. This process potentially broadens the therapeutic window and improves the utility of complementary targeted therapies.

Specializing in diagnostic testing for hereditary disorders, Invitae is aggregating the world's genetic tests into a single service with high quality, faster turnaround time, and a lower price than virtually any other comparable test available today. Our genetic testing capabilities span more than 1,500 disease genes tested with next-generation sequencing and have delivered results for more than 500,000 patients referred for a variety of disorders in oncology, cardiology, neurology, pediatrics and rare disease.

Invitae has invested over $100 million in developing state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing (NGS) infrastructure coupled with robust bioinformatics algorithms specifically tailored for high sensitivity and specificity, enabling detection of several types of pathogenic changes, including single nucleotide variants, indels, rare structural variants, and exonic deletions and duplications. We perform full-gene sequencing and exon-level deletion/duplication analysis of all genes from NGS data itself.

There are many clinically relevant genes that are associated with human disease but are technically challenging, from a sequencing or variant calling perspective, when using a typical bioinformatics pipeline. Traditionally, clinical molecular testing for these genes is costly, expensive, time consuming, and not scalable. The mission of Invitae's HTD team is to discover innovative solutions to tackle these technically challenging regions of the genome, in a scalable way, that results in high quality, faster turnaround time, and lower cost than traditional methods. This team will focus on clinically relevant regions of the genome that suffer from, but are not limited to: highly paralogous sequence, regions of low complexity, active gene conversion or gene fusion events, haplotyping, repeat elements, and epigenetic marks. By better understanding the limitations of traditional approaches such as in-solution hybridization capture, Illumina short read sequencing, reference genome inaccurateness/incompleteness, and off the shelf variant calling packages such as GATK, we can make modifications to existing tools or implement novel technologies to answer these complex questions.

What you bring:
PhD in bioinformatics or related area with at least 3 years of post-degree experience in bioinformatics, preferably in industry or a cutting edge and research-oriented academic institution; or Master's degree with experience sufficient to demonstrate equivalency

The Peters lab at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) is looking for a bioinformatician to join our NIH-funded efforts in profiling immune system responses in infectious diseases, such as M. tuberculosis, B. Pertussis and SARS-CoV-2. Qualified applicants will have multiple opportunities to collaborate with our interdisciplinary team of experimental and computational scientists working towards understanding, preventing and curing infectious diseases. The Postdoctoral Fellowship position is expected to be filled by candidates holding a PhD degree looking for advanced training positions, and will typically be for a period of 2-5 years.

Applicants are encouraged to indicate one or more potential matches to specific research areas noted above in their application, but there is also the possibility to create custom positions for applicants that do not match the specifics here but have outstanding skills in at least two of the following areas:
Experimental data analysis (RNA-Seq, flow/mass cytometry, single cell analysis)
Immunology (adaptive immunity and epitope recognition)
Data analysis techniques (statistics, data visualization, machine learning)
Software development (programming in Python preferred, or proficiency in other programming languages; Unix Shell; version control)

How to apply: Interested candidates must include a cover letter describing why they are interested in this position. Applications without a cover letter included will not be reviewed.

Background: TB

Almost 2 billion individuals are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Despite the relative low lifetime risk of latently infected individuals developing active disease (~5-15%) it has been estimated that 80% of new cases of TB are due to reactivation of latent disease. To meet World Health Organization's (WHO) goals of TB eradication by 2035 the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed. Our long-term goal is to develop an efficient diagnostic test that can predict which individuals are likely to progress to active TB.

Background: Pertussis

In the mid-1990s, concerns over vaccine-related side effects prompted the widespread replacement of the whole-cell Pertussis (wP) vaccine in favor of a safer acellular Pertussis (aP) vaccine. Recent years witnessed a worldwide reemergence of Pertussis (whooping cough) despite widespread vaccination. Our approach is to compare individuals born before 1995 and vaccinated in infancy with wP, with individuals born in 1996 or later and vaccinated with aP in infancy, thus directly studying the population and age group in which the increased disease incidence is noted. Our long-term goal is to identify the cascade of immune events following Pertussis booster vaccination, and to identify correlates of long-lasting vaccine-induced immunity.

Background: COVID-19

Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that commonly causes cold- and flu-like symptoms. It is present throughout the world, though outbreaks of new strains have occurred in the recent past. Since late 2019, a new strain has been identified as part of an outbreak in Hubei Province, China (“2019-novel coronavirus” or “SARS-CoV-2”). As more and more people become infected with this new strain of the virus, it is important to understand as much as we can about how this strain of the virus affects the human immune system.

Working Title:
Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioinformatics

Campus:
UNC Charlotte

Region:
Piedmont/Triangle

Job Summary:
""A Postdoctoral Fellow (""""postdoc"""") is a professional apprenticeship designed to provide recent Ph.D. recipients with an opportunity to develop further the research skills acquired in their doctoral programs or to learn new research techniques, in preparation for an academic or research career. In the process of further developing their own research skills, it is expected that Postdoctoral Fellows will also play a significant role in the performance of research at the University and augment the role of graduate faculty in providing research instruction to graduate students. A Postdoctoral Fellow works under the supervision of a regular faculty member, who serves as a mentor to the Fellow, and it is expected that the faculty mentor will impart the realities, and variety, of scientific careers, and will encourage experiences outside the laboratory to broaden postdocs' aspirations. Within the confines of the particular research focus assigned by that faculty member, the Postdoctoral Fellow functions with a considerable degree of independence and has the freedom (and is expected) to publish the results of his or her research or scholarship during the period of appointment. Thus, the role of Postdoctoral Fellows is clearly differentiated from full-time technical employees. Postdoc appointments are characterized by all of the following conditions: * the appointee was recently (within the last two years) awarded a Ph.D. * the appointment is temporary; * the appointment involves substantially full-time research or scholarship; * the appointment is viewed as preparatory for a full-time academic and/or research career; * the appointee works under the supervision of a faculty member; and * the appointee is expected to publish the results of his or her research or scholarship during the period of appointment. As an EOE/AA employer and an ADVANCE Institution that strives to create an academic climate in which the dignity of all individuals is respected and maintained, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte encourages applications from all underrepresented groups.

Targeted therapies work by attacking cells that express particular proteins on their surface. Unfortunately, both diseased and healthy cells often express the same proteins, resulting in collateral damage to healthy cells.

At Vor, we engineer hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to lack a biologically redundant target protein, then transplant these cells into the patient.

These eHSCs give rise to generations of new healthy blood cells that are effectively invisible to targeted therapies. Diseased cells displaying the target protein and are then vulnerable to attack. This process potentially broadens the therapeutic window and improves the utility of complementary targeted therapies.

Targeted therapies work by attacking cells that express particular proteins on their surface. Unfortunately, both diseased and healthy cells often express the same proteins, resulting in collateral damage to healthy cells.

At Vor, we engineer hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to lack a biologically redundant target protein, then transplant these cells into the patient.

These eHSCs give rise to generations of new healthy blood cells that are effectively invisible to targeted therapies. Diseased cells displaying the target protein and are then vulnerable to attack. This process potentially broadens the therapeutic window and improves the utility of complementary targeted therapies.

Targeted therapies work by attacking cells that express particular proteins on their surface. Unfortunately, both diseased and healthy cells often express the same proteins, resulting in collateral damage to healthy cells.

At Vor, we engineer hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to lack a biologically redundant target protein, then transplant these cells into the patient.

These eHSCs give rise to generations of new healthy blood cells that are effectively invisible to targeted therapies. Diseased cells displaying the target protein and are then vulnerable to attack. This process potentially broadens the therapeutic window and improves the utility of complementary targeted therapies.

Targeted therapies work by attacking cells that express particular proteins on their surface. Unfortunately, both diseased and healthy cells often express the same proteins, resulting in collateral damage to healthy cells.

At Vor, we engineer hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to lack a biologically redundant target protein, then transplant these cells into the patient.

These eHSCs give rise to generations of new healthy blood cells that are effectively invisible to targeted therapies. Diseased cells displaying the target protein and are then vulnerable to attack. This process potentially broadens the therapeutic window and improves the utility of complementary targeted therapies.

Targeted therapies work by attacking cells that express particular proteins on their surface. Unfortunately, both diseased and healthy cells often express the same proteins, resulting in collateral damage to healthy cells.

At Vor, we engineer hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to lack a biologically redundant target protein, then transplant these cells into the patient.

These eHSCs give rise to generations of new healthy blood cells that are effectively invisible to targeted therapies. Diseased cells displaying the target protein and are then vulnerable to attack. This process potentially broadens the therapeutic window and improves the utility of complementary targeted therapies.

These eHSCs give rise to generations of new healthy blood cells that are effectively invisible to targeted therapies. Diseased cells displaying the target protein and are then vulnerable to attack. This process potentially broadens the therapeutic window and improves the utility of complementary targeted therapies.

Vor Biopharma is thrilled to have been chosen as the 2019 Xconomy Cell Therapy Platform of the year. We are well-funded by 5AM Ventures and RA Capital, among others. Please visit our website at https://www.vorbiopharma.com/ for more information.
